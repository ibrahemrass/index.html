    <p>Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky
        , a team formed in Madrid in 1897.
         The club was officially founded in 1902 and joined
          the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909.
           Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until
            ambitious club president Santiago Bernabéu
             spearheaded the construction of the stadium that
              bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds
               more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue for the 1982
                Fédération Internationale de Football Association
                 (FIFA) World Cup final.</p>
